# FYI
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GooVille is now defunct and I will not update this source. This source is pretty unfinished and there are most bugs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# WHAT IS GOOVILLE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GooVille is a old Google archive dating back to 2009 and more versions of Google.

# HOW TO HOST IT

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To host GooVille, you will need these following items:
- Atleast 100MB of storage
- A website hosting platform (replit, glitch etc.)
- 1-2 core CPU
- If you are hosting this by yourself: A computer with UwAMP or something like that.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# STEPS - HOSTING SERVICE

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1:
Download the source (if you haven't yet) and import it inside your host server. Then, you will have to adjust some files and update any text that has GooVille inside. Finally, you can update the ```index.html``` file if needed.

Step 2:
Test out anything that you have updated. These files are old and may even corrupt if you change even a little bit, be careful. After you've fixed everything, you can now boot up your server. This may take a couple of seconds or even minutes depending on how much your allocated space is.

Step 3:
If you want, you could add more versions from ```https://archive.org/``` and search for ```google.com```. Finally, you can have fun and add many more things!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# STEPS - SERVERS (HOST MACHINES TOO)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1:
Download the source and get your application that you use to host websites with (VS, UwAmp etc.)

Step 2:
Update any text that has GooVille inside and then update any pages you want.

Step 3:
After you've done adjusting anything and you want to test it, open your hosting program, enter ```127.0.0.1``` or ```localhost``` as the IP you want to host it in, then choose the port as ```8080```.

Note: This source doesn't have any search engines, and is just for page purpose. Don't try
to search either way, it won't work.

GooVille may come back in Late 2023 - Early 2024 as GoRev.
